BitPredict - Bitcoin Price Prediction and Forecasting

This project focuses on predicting and forecasting Bitcoin prices using time series analysis and the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. 
\n
The analysis involves :
data preprocessing, 
stationarity tests, 
trend and seasonality elimination, 
and the application of ARIMA models to make predictions. 

\n
Two models, ARIMA and Moving Average (MA), are evaluated, and the results are compared.
